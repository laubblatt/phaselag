Description: Calculate the phase lag between two time series in time units, 
    extending the Camuffo-Bernardi (1980) regression model with a harmonic
    analysis.
    The functions accompany a scientific manuscript
     published in the Journal Hydrology and Earth System Sciences
     as Renner et al., 2019 "Using phase lags to evaluate model biases
    in simulating the diurnal cycle of evapotranspiration:
   a case study in Luxembourg, Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 515-535,
    https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-515-2019, 2019.
    It also contains some statistical utilities 
    as well as simple meteorological functions.
